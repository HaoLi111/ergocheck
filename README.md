Reactive UI to calculate for kitchen design triangle model.
The kitchen working triangle is a planning rule to assign the position of food storage, stove, and sink(the dots). It restricts it by the side lengths of the triangle formed by the positions of the 3 things(the segments connecting to a triangle). Too short is considered unsafe, too long is considered inconvenient.
Given the position of 2 things, it is possible to solve for a feasible position of the 3rd thing(plotting the green region by "plot range"). 
When we get the position of all three things. We can measure the area of a triangle and compare it to the standard. and compute the deviance from an "ideal" equilateral triangle. 

# project
This project is to create handy calculators to evaluate the planning of rooms, in this case, the kitchen working triangle, the position of living room furniture to meet the ergonomic need of interior design.
